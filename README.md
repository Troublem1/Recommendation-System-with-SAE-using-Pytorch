We will be using PyTorch to build a Stacked Autoencoder for a Recommender System Model.
We will implement PyTorch tensors in this recommender system as well to build our Autoencoder.
To learn more about how to use PyTorch, go to https://pytorch.org/tutorials/.
Also to learn the overall intuition behind Stacked (Denoising) AEs, check out this paper: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/vincent10a/vincent10a.pdf.
